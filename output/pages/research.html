<p>In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EVACejsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Doug Altshuler's</a> lab at UBC I've been studying a variety of topics on the wing musculature of birds. Avian flight is a remarkably poorly understood area that sits at the meeting point of many different complex phenomena such as unsteady aerodynamics, solid mechanics, and evolutionary biology, and the avian wing is capable of dramatic and highly dynamic changes in shape to control airflow.</p>
<p>How this dynamic wing morphing is actually produced and modulated by the underlying muscle tissue and skeletal structure of the wing is an open mystery, so developed a study to take an important and highly unusual muscle system, the elbow flexion system, and reverse-engineer its temporal tuning, dynamic behaviours, and overall role in tuning wing kinematics. This project was a blast, in that I was able to combine a huge variety of techniques, including electromyography and kinematics data from birds <em>in vivo</em>, <em>in vitro</em> characterizing muscle-tendon systems, studying morphometric data with phylogenetic comparative methods, and mechanical modeling, all in service to a unifying hypothesis. </p>
<p>The final paper is in progress, with some exciting discoveries of really unusual muscular systems, but for now there's some small seminars covering parts of the overall work I can share:</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to spend a number of internships working in the High Temperature and Smart Alloys group at NASA Glenn under the mentorship of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CCqWq1MAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Othmane Benafan</a>. Here I got to work on a variety of projects involving the development and application of Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs), often high temperature NiTiHf alloys. My work in these internships was immensely varied, and included (but was not limited to) performing data analysis for a variety of projects, developing software tools to search high-dimensional data for new and promising materials, building and maintaining experimental hardware including calorimetry experiments, temperature controllers, and actuator testing frames, and working on teams to design and demonstrate new technologies, such as a passively actuated cooling system for electric aircraft motors. There's still more papers coming from my time there, but for now there's a journal article and internal report from my work.</p>

<p><img alt="An image sampling some of my origami research should go here. Whoops." src="/images/research_origamiSample.png" title="A couple figures from an in-progress paper from my undergraduate work. Left comes from an analysis of this origami mechanism's kinematics, right comes from a model of the system compared to an actual prototype. The model was alright-ish."></p>
<p>The bulk of my undergraduate research was performed in the MAESTRO Lab at Texas A&amp;M under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WqVUJmcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Dr. Darren Hartl</a>, working with SMAs and origami-based mechanisms. Here I ran an independent project where I designed a parallel-limb "robot" whose limbs were based on the bistable waterbomb base fold of classical origami, allowing it to switch between an open state where the mechanism could fold flat and a locked state where the mechanism self-intersected to prevent collapsing. This mechanism was a great topic of study in my undergraduate time, as it gave me the opportunity to learn how to develop working prototypes actuated by NiTi wires in torsion, as well as develop some theoretical acumen modeling the structure and analyzing the kinematics and energy landscape of its folding transitions. Not much published work, but I do have a (very rough) smaller work that did come out of my time in this lab.</p>
