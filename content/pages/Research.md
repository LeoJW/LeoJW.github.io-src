# [Altshuler Lab at UBC](http://altshuler.zoology.ubc.ca/)
September 2018 - Present

In Doug Altshuler's lab at UBC I've been studying a variety of topics on the wing musculature of birds. Avian flight is a remarkably poorly understood area that sits at the meeting point of many different complex phenomena such as unsteady aerodynamics, solid mechanics, and evolutionary biology, and the avian wing is capable of dramatic and highly dynamic changes in shape to control airflow. How this dynamic wing morphing is actually produced and modulated by the underlying muscle tissue and skeletal structure of the wing is an open mystery which presented an interesting extension of my previous research and a fascinating challenge of experimental technique.

	I was fortunate enough to spend a number of internships working in the High Temperature and Smart Alloys group at NASA Glenn under the mentorship of [Othmane Benafan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CCqWq1MAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Here I got to work on a variety of projects involving the development and application of Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs), often high temperature NiTiHf alloys. My work in these internships was varied, and included (but was not limited to) developing software tools and performing data analysis for a variety of projects, building and maintaining experimental hardware including calorimetry experiments, temperature controllers, and actuator testing frames, and working on teams to design and demonstrate new technologies, such as a passively acutated cooling system for electric aircraft motors.
