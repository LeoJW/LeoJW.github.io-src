# [Altshuler Lab at UBC](http://altshuler.zoology.ubc.ca/)
September 2018 - Present

In Doug Altshuler's lab at UBC I've been studying a variety of topics on the wing musculature of birds. Avian flight is a remarkably poorly understood area that sits at the meeting point of many different complex phenomena such as unsteady aerodynamics, solid mechanics, and evolutionary biology, and the avian wing is capable of dramatic and highly dynamic changes in shape to control airflow. How this dynamic wing morphing is actually produced and modulated by the underlying muscle tissue and skeletal structure of the wing is an open mystery which presented an interesting extension of my previous research and a fascinating challenge of experimental technique.

June 2017 - August 2017, January 2018 - August 2018

I was fortunate enough to spend a number of internships working in the High Temperature and Smart Alloys group at NASA Glenn under the mentorship of [Othmane Benafan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CCqWq1MAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Here I got to work on a variety of projects involving the development and application of Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs), often high temperature NiTiHf alloys. My work in these internships was varied, and included (but was not limited to) developing software tools and performing data analysis for a variety of projects, building and maintaining experimental hardware including calorimetry experiments, temperature controllers, and actuator testing frames, and working on teams to design and demonstrate new technologies, such as a passively actuated cooling system for electric aircraft motors.

# [MAESTRO Lab at Texas A&M](https://maestrolab.tamu.edu)
May 2015 - December 2017

The bulk of my undergraduate research was performed in the MAESTRO Lab at Texas A&M under [Dr. Darren Hartl](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WqVUJmcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), working with SMAs and origami-based mechanisms. Here I ran an independent project where I designed a parallel-limb "robot" whose limbs were based on the bistable waterbomb base fold of classical origami, allowing it to switch between an open state where the mechanism could fold flat and a locked state where the mechanism self-intersected to prevent collapsing. This mechanism was a great topic of study in my undergraduate time, as it gave me the opportunity to learn how to develop working prototypes actuated by NiTi wires in torsion, as well as develop some theoretical acumen modeling the structure and analyzing the kinematics and energy landscape of its folding transitions. A final journal article on this work is still in progress, but for now I do have a (very rough) smaller work that did come out of my time in this lab.
