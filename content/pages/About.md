I'm Leo Wood, currently a PhD student at Georgia Tech studying muscle neuromechanics and motor control.

I would characterize myself as a generalist: I'm interested in using a combination of many techniques and disciplines to develop and understand complex systems. I find the most interesting work tends to occur at the unity of traditional dichotomies, which is why I enjoy approaches which combine theory and experiment, basic science and applied engineering, towards developing new knowledge and technologies. This generalist attitude is well-reflected in my education&mdash; I obtained my B.S. in mechanical engineering with a minor in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University, afterwards obtaining a M.Sc. in Zoology at the University of British Columbia. I'm now working on a PhD in the Quantitative Biosciences program at Georgia Tech.

You can read more details on my previous research under the research tab of this site. All of my previous work deals with studying how solid matter can generate and control motion, whether that matter is a Shape Memory Alloy or a muscle. My past work has carried this interest through a variety of topics, including electric aircraft cooling, origami-based bistable mechanisms, and developing analysis pipelines for years-long durability experiments. For years now, though, I'm firmly a biologist. Turns out studying the interactions between the low-level physiology of muscle with nervous system control is the most endlessly exciting topic.

In my spare time I'm an avid musician, lover of nonfiction and science fiction, and proud owner of [the world's greatest mutt]({static}/images/Bonnie.jpg).
