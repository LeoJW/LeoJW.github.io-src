I'm Leo Wood, currently a Master's student at the University of British Columbia, and I'm broadly interested in the design and functionality of multifunctional, nonlinear mechanical systems. 

You can read more details on my previous research under the research tab of this site. Broadly, all of my work deals with how active materials, multifunctional design, and an embrace of nonlinearity can produce mechanical systems with a greater envelope of capabilities and performance than linear-elastic materials and traditional design principles. This notion I've carried through research on a wide array of topics, including bird wing musculature, electric aircraft cooling systems, and origami-based bistable mechanisms. 

I would characterize myself as a generalist: I'm interested in using a combination of many techniques and disciplines to develop and understand complex systems. This attitude is why I try to incorporate both sides of traditional dichotomies


In my spare time I'm an avid musician, lover of nonfiction and science fiction, and proud owner of [the world's greatest mutt]({filename}/images/Bonnie.jpg).
