I'm Leo Wood, currently a PhD student at Georgia Tech, and I'm broadly interested in the study and design of multifunctional, nonlinear mechanical systems. 

I would characterize myself as a generalist: I'm interested in using a combination of many techniques and disciplines to develop and understand complex systems. I find the most interesting work tends to occur at the unity of traditional dichotomies, which is why I enjoy approaches which combine theory and experiment, basic science and applied engineering, towards developing new technologies. This generalist attitude is well-reflected in my education&mdash; I obtained my B.S. in mechanical engineering with a minor in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University, afterwards obtaining a M.Sc. in Zoology at the University of British Columbia. I'm now working in the Quantitative Biosciences program at Georgia Tech, working on muscle neuromechanics.

You can read more details on my previous research under the research tab of this site. All of my work deals with how active materials, multifunctional design, and an embrace of nonlinearity can produce mechanical systems with a greater envelope of capabilities and performance than linear-elastic materials and traditional design principles. This notion I've carried through research on a wide array of topics, including bird wing musculature, electric aircraft cooling systems, and origami-based bistable mechanisms. 

In my spare time I'm an avid musician, lover of nonfiction and science fiction, and proud owner of [the world's greatest mutt]({static}/images/Bonnie.jpg).
